# LatentSpaceModels_forNeuralAnalysis
This repository contains the code and project manuscript for the Probabilistic Time Series Analysis Data Science graduate course. (Project manuscript link)[https://www.overleaf.com/read/ycwpxhpmybrn]

This project puts together a series of previously described Latent space models and compares them in a unified framework for the analysis of neural data. It compares the performance of these models in their ability to extract a known and biologically relevant latent istead to comparing their prediction error at reconstructing observations.

## This repository contains python implementations of:
- Factor Analysis (FA) inference and learning (via EM).
- Linear Dynamical System (LDS) inference and learning for multi-trial data (via EM).
- Poisson Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (PGPFA) inference and learning (via EM). Orignal code by Hooram Nam in Macke lab (github_repo)[https://gitlab.podri.org/nhooram/poisson-gpfa)]
- Spiking neural network described in (Bourdoukan et al. NeurIPS, 2012)[https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/hash/3a15c7d0bbe60300a39f76f8a5ba6896-Abstract.html]. Original code by Caroline Haimerl (github_repo)[https://github.com/CarolineHaimerl27/LatentSpaceModels]
- Dynamical systems neural network model of decision making described in (Wang Neuron, 2002)[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12467598/]
